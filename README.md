# Rules
Here is some information that I included in the "information" part of the website. Please add variations to the rules that you use.

Pfeffer is a midwestern American card game. In a standard four player game, it involves 24 cards, the Ace, King, Queen, Jack, 10, and 9 of each suit. With more players, additional cards are added. It is similar to Bid Euchre in that there is a suit chosen to be "trump", partners, and a bidding process. It is typically for four players, but can be made into three player, five or six players... by using blinds and/or "call for partner" techniques.

Dealing for each hand rotates in a clockwise fashion. In a standard four player game, the person to the left of the dealer begins the bidding process and may bid how many rounds they estimate that they and their partner can win. Each round awards a point or "trick", and each hand generally awards a total of six points among the two teams, and 12 and 24 points if pfeffer and hassenpfeffer bids are made (respectively). Each partnership receives a point for each trick that they take during the hand irregardless of who bids or whether the bidding party is succesful in their bid. The game is won when a team reaches 24 points, or the number of cards in the deck if there are more. The following players in a clockwise fashion place their bids, and the dealer bids last, or if nobody has bid they are "dumped" or forced into a minimum bid, which is generally half the available tricks per round (a 3 trick bid would be the minimum in a standard four player, 24 card game). The minimum bid rationale is that you are betting that you and your partner can take half or more of the tricks.

A bid wagering all the tricks in the round is referred to as a Pfeffer bid, which while it is a 6 bid (the amount of rounds in a four person, 24 card game), it is worth 12 points. When this occurs, it becomes a three person game. Trump is declared by the Pfeffer candidate and the partner of the candidate gives the bidder their best card and the bidder may choose to accept that card and discard one of their own, or to discard it. The player to the right of the Pfeffer candidate begins play, and play continues normally as a three person game. If a player "Pfeffers", a subsequent bidder may place a Hassenpfeffer bid. The winning Hassenpfeffer candidate then enters into a two person game with the Pfeffer bidder. Trump is declared by the Hassenpfeffer candidate and the partner of the candidate that has bid gives the bidder their best card and the bidder may choose to accept that card and discard one of their own, or to discard it. The Pfeffer bidder plays first, but does not receive a card from their partner. Similarly to a Pfeffer bid, while a Hassenpfeffer bid is only a 6 bid, it is worth 24 points, or the amount to win the entire game.

The player who wins the bid chooses which suit is trump, or may select no trump. A bid is a bet and naturally carries risk. If the bidder and his/her partner does not succesfully complete their bid, they lose the number of points that they bid. This is referred to as getting "set." So if a player bids four, but only wins three tricks, their total score for the game is reduced by four, while the other team adds the number of tricks that they scored during the game. If they bid a Pfeffer or a Hassenpfeffer and lose, they subtract 12 or 24 points from their total respectively.

Once the trump has been determined, the jack of the trump suit is the highest card on the table, and the jick is the second highest. The jick is the jack of the same color but not that suit. So if hearts are trump, the jack of diamonds would be the jick. The cards then fall in normal ace high fashion. In the case of a "no trump" bid, it is ace high, and the bidder may not have their own lead. When there are more cards and players involved, jokers are occasionally added, and they trump all cards including the jack of trump. If a double deck is played (as is often the case for six or more players), the first card that is played defeats the same card played later in the trick. So if a player leads a jack of diamonds and the next card is another jack of diamonds, the first one would defeat the second one.

The first card of the round is played by the player to the left of the dealer, except as indicated above (no trump, pfeffer, hassenpfeffer bids). The cards are presented clockwise from that point. The strategy depends on if you are the bidding party or if you are not the bidding party. The bidding party typically tries to lead by pulling trump, as they usually have high trump, and then play their high cards which cannot be trumped. The non-bidding party usually tries to lead non-trump high cards, hoping that their opponents will have lower cards in that suit and will not be able to take their lead. The bidding party usually has considerable advantage, dependant upon the riskiness of their bid, so appropriate and proportionate bidding is usually key to winning the overall game. Successful players usually recall how many trump, and other relevant high cards have been played throughout the game and play based on this information.

There can be considerable deviation from this when addional players are added. The critical aspects that must be respected are an even amount of cards distributed to the number of players, and partnerships. When the number of cards is impossible to evenly distribute among the players, a "blind" will be added. This set of cards, which is however many are left over when the maximum number of cards are dealt evenly (from one to 'the number of players minus one' cards). The winning bidder will get to choose amongst the blind cards which ones to keep or discard (returning to the original number of cards), but they may only examine the blind after they have declared trump. Often with non-standard games (three, or five plus players) call for partners arrangements will be added. In this arrangement, the winning bidder calls for his partner by naming a card in their hand. So, they might declare that spades are trump, and declare that their partner is the player that plays the jick (which in this case would be the jack of clubs). In cases where there are multiple decks (which is common in call for partner Pfeffer games), they may also call for the first jick in the case that there are multiple jicks in other players hands. The winning bidder may call for whatever they choose, but strategy dictates that they call for the strongest card that they do not have.

Pfeffer is a strategic card game that is very fun. It has mostly been taught in a word of mouth fashion, and because of that is very similar to many other midwestern American card games.
